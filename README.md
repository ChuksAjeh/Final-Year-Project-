# Final-Year-Project-
My Computer Science Final Year Project Investigating correlation between Public Sentiment Data data and Financial Data from the S&amp;P 500

## Overview:

In this project I made a project that looked to understand the relationship between market sentiment data vs market price movement. I created a custom Bi-Directional LSTM model using Tensorflow Library. For comparison I used three other models, Textblob, Flair and Vader. Textblob and Vader are rule-based leixcon type models whilst Flair is another machine learning model like my custom model. The dataset use was DIJA dataset found on Kaggle.

The code runs from main and you have the option to load more of the custom models I saved. These were the resulting models from experiments I had done. if you want more information on these experiments please refer to my paper in the on the repo or contact me for more details.

# Results from the Project:
My model is 50.7% accurate. Not much better than the flip of a coin, but it does work. Textblob proved to be the most accuracte at 51%. Module wise the paper and other related work scored the following:
- Initial Document - Project Proposal 63% - Upper Second Class
- Presentation of Initial Project - 78% - First Class
- Presentation of Final Project - 74% - First Class
- Dissertation - 75% - First Class 

All of these works have been uploaded should you wish to see them. Having checked with the university they are subject to my IP rights.

Again any questions about the paper or the models or results please contact me email is on my profile. 

I have commented the code but I understand it to be messy, if a more 'ready to run version' is required please contact me and I will make one accordingly.
